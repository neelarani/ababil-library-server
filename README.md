## Library Management API

Library Management API is a powerful and developer-friendly RESTful backend
application built using TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB. It is designed to
manage books and borrowing activities efficiently in a library system.

With this API, administrators can easily add new books, update existing ones,
delete old entries, and handle borrowing tasks like tracking due dates and
checking available copies. The system uses strong schema validation to ensure
accurate data and provides clear error messages to make development easier.
